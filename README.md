## Project description
  The goal of the project is to train a neural network to take images of mathematical equations from PDF documents and convert the information into LaTeX. This is important as there is no reliable free option that can read math equations from a PDF and convert them into a machine readable language like LaTeX. Ideally, the project will encompass different fields of mathematics including but not limited to calculus, linear algebra,and differential equations. This project could be useful in impacting the lives of students in math courses, people in math careers, and any disabled persons that cannot read from a PDF and must have the information translated to them in another form like it being read out to them.
  
  The model will likely need CNN or transformers along with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. We will be using datasets that have an input of PDF pages with math on them, and a key consisting of the corresponding LaTeX formatting of each PDF page. One key resource we plan to use is archived scholarly articles on arXiv.org, as this open-access archive stores math journals in both PDF form and their corresponding LaTeX file.
